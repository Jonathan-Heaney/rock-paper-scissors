# rock-paper-scissors

Odin Project- Rock Paper Scissors

Created a working Rock Paper Scissors game- plays 5 rounds, shows the winner of each round as you go, and prints the winner at the end.

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, JS


## Lessons/Learnings
- Always remember to actually CALL the functions- defining a function doesn't do anything on its own
- Be really aware of mixing up assignment/equality operators- my function didn't work for a while because I was checking for equality with =
- First time with DOM manipulation
